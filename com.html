<h4>Computer, -- 
A computer is an electronic device, operating under the control of instructions stored in its own memory that can accept data (input), process the data according to specified rules, produce information (output), and store the information for future use.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>Functionalities of a computer,
Any digital computer carries out five functions in gross terms:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><li>TAKES DATA AS INPUT</li></p>
<p><li>STORES THE DATA/INSTRUCTIONS IN ITS •MEMORY AND USE THEM WHEN REQUIRED</li></p>
<p><li>PROCESSES THE DATA AND CONVERTS IT INTO •USEFUL INFORMATION</li></p>
<p><li>GENERATES THE OUTPUT</li></p>
<p><li>CONTROLS ALL THE ABOVE</li></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Computer Hardware, -- COMPUTER HARDWARE refers to the physical components of a computer, such as the case, CPU, RAM, monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers, and motherboard. It distinguishes hardware from software, which is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>PARTS OF COMPUTER</p>
<li>Central Processing Unit (CPU or PROCESSOR)</li>
<li>RAM</li>
<li>ROM</li>
<li> SUPPLY</li>
<li>CASING</li>
<li>MONITOR</li>
<li>KEYBOARD</li>
<li>MOUSE</li>
<li>PRINTER</li>
<li>SPEAKER</li>
<br>
<br>
<p>PROCESSOR (CPU), -- Central Processing Unit (CPU) A CPU is brain of a computer. It is responsible for all functions and processes. Regarding computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system.</p>
<img src="cm2.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>RAM (RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY) -- RAM: Random Access Memory (RAM) is a memory scheme within the computer system responsible for storing data on a temporary basis, so that it can be promptly accessed by the processor as and when needed. It is volatile in nature, which means that data will be erased once supply to the storage device is turned off. RAM stores data randomly and the processor accesses these data randomly from the RAM storage. RAM is considered "random access" because you can access any memory cell directly if you know the row and column that intersect at that cell.</p>
<img src="cm3.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>ROM (Read Only Memory) -- ROM (Read Only Memory): ROM is a permanent form of storage. ROM stays active regardless of whether power supply to it is turned on or off. ROM devices do not allow data stored on them to be modified.</p>
<img src="cm4.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>MOTHERBOARD -- A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer that holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.0 It is the biggest board in a computer chassis and serves as a central communications backbone connectivity point through which all components and external peripherals connect.</p>

        <div id="rightbox">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>POWER SUPPLY UNIT (PSU), -- A power supply unit (PSU) is an electrical device that converts AC power from a wall socket into DC power that PC components can use.4 It supplies power to everything contained in the computer chassis, including the motherboard, RAM, CPU, hard drive, disc drives, and most video cards.</p>
<img src="cm6.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>COMPUTER MONITOR -- A computer monitor is an electronic output device that displays information in pictorial or textual form. It comprises a visual display, support electronics, power supply, housing, electrical connectors, and external user controls.2 Older monitors used cathode ray tubes (CRT), which made them large, heavy, and inefficient.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>KEYBOARD and MOUSE, -- A QWERTY COMPUTER KEYBOARD in US layout. Keyboard with backlight. A computer keyboard is an input device that allows a person to enter letters, numbers, and other symbols (together, these are called characters) into a computer. It is one of the most used input devices for computers.</p>
<br>
<p>A COMPUTER MOUSE with the most common features: two buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel (which also functions as a button) ... A computer mouse (plural mice, also mouses) is a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.</p>
<img src="cm8.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>PRINTER, -- A printer is an external hardware output device that takes electronic data stored on a computer or other device and generates a hard copy. It accepts text and graphic output from a computer and transfers the information to paper, usually to standard-size, 8.5" by 11" sheets of paper. Printers vary in size, speed, sophistication, and cost, with more expensive printers used for more frequent printing or high-resolution color printing.</p>
<img src="cm9.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>SPEAKER -- A PC speaker is an output hardware device that connects to a computer to generate sound.2 The signal used to produce the sound is created by the computer's sound card, which includes sound jacks for microphones and speakers. Most computers have a sound card installed by default, which includes sound jacks for microphones and speakers.</p>

<br>
<p>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</p>
<img src="cm11.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>COMPUTER SOFTWARE, --
Computer software is a set of instructions, data, and programs used in a computer's hardware to help the device operate and complete tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical components of a computer.</p>
<img src="cm12.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>Software Types, -- 1. SYSTEM SOFTWARE - is responsible for controlling, integrating, and managing the individual hardware components of a computer system so that other software and the users of the system see it as a functional unit without having to be concerned with the low-level details such as transferring data from memory to disk, or rendering text onto a display. Generally, system software consists of an operating system and some fundamental utilities such as disk formatters, file managers, display managers, text editors, user authentication (login) and management tools, and networking and device control software.</p>
<img src="cm13.PNG" alt="Trulli" width="400" height="auto">
<br>
<br>
<p>APPLICATION SOFTWARE –- is used to accomplish specific tasks other than just running the computer system. Application software may consist of a single program, such as an image viewer; a small collection of programs (often called a software package) that work closely together to accomplish a task, such as a spreadsheet or text processing system; a larger collection (often called a software suite) of related but independent programs and packages that have a common user interface or shared data format, such as Microsoft Office, which consists of closely integrated word processor, spreadsheet, database, etc.; or a software system, such as a database management system, which is a collection of fundamental programs that may provide some service to a variety of other independent applications.</p>
